\section{Introduction}

This document presents the requirements for TimeMate. TimeMate is a system whose purpose and main functionality is to administer time reporting with web-usage capabilities. 


\section{Reference Documents}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Software Requirements Specification: \emph{BaseBlockSystem}, v. 1.0, Doc. number: PUSS12002
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background and Goals}
\subsection{Main Goals}

The goal is to develop and distribute a web-based system where the user can report time and administrate the system according to their roles.

\subsection{Actors and their Objectives}
The system can be used and administrated by the following actors:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User:} The user has the authority to log in to the system to report and  change past reported time as well as review their reported times. The user also inherits roles as either "PG", "SG", "UG" or "TG".
  \item \textbf{Project Leader:}
  The project leaders' main objective is to administer groups within the project. This implies that the project leader has the authority to add and remove as well as assign users from/to designated roles.
   \item \textbf{Administrator:} The administrator has the authority to add and remove users from the system along with creating and removing project groups. The administrator is the only role that can assign the role “Project leader” to a user. The main goal of this role is to be able to administrate creation and removal of users.
\end{itemize}


\section{Terminology}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{UG, SG \& TG} These roles are only name tags for  users and grants no special permissions or rights.
\item \textbf{Administrator:} 
  Has access to all functions of the system.
\item \textbf{Time report:}
  A document containing fields detailing time spent on various parts of development.
\item \textbf{SHA-2:}
  A set of cryptographic hash functions used to protect users passwords.
\item \textbf{Salt string:}
  A salt string is a random string that is used in conjunction with SHA-2 to create safer passwords and protect against attacks.
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Requirements}
\item The requirements of \emph{BaseBlockSystem} applies to this document and are therefore implemented in TimeMate. The following requirements will \emph{not} be implemented; 6.2.3, 6.3.4

\subsection{Login and Logout}


\subsubsection{Requirement}
If the user requests a new password, they should receive a newly generated password from the server to the email connected to their username. The users current password is then overwritten with the new password.

\subsubsection{Requirement}
When a new user is registered, a new password, generated by the server, should be assigned to that user. The password should be sent to the users email.

\subsection{Data}
\subsubsection{Requirement}
A password should consist of at least one character of each type. [a-z][A-Z][1-9] with a minimum of 8 characters.
\subsubsection{Requirement}
Passwords should be encrypted using SHA-2 and include a randomly generated salt string in the encryption process.
